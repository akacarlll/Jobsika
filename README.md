# 🚀 Jobsika  

Jobsika is a tool that helps you track your job applications effortlessly.     
It organizes the data from job descriptions you applied to into Google Sheets. 

You can paste a job description or an url from multiple websites (LinkedIn, Welcome to the Jungle, HelloWork, etc.) and the information will be stored in a Google Sheet.

Jobsika also generates insightful dashboards so you can analyze your job hunt progress, all in one place.  

You can already test the app on [Jobsika](https://jobsika.onrender.com).
